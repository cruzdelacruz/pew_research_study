NOTES

ATP W144 included four modules that asked respondents about four different platforms: Facebook, Instagram, X (previously Twitter), and TikTok. Respondents first indicated their usage of these platforms in SMUSE. Respondents then received up to three modules corresponding to their indicated usage. If a respondent indicated using all four platforms, they were randomly assigned to either the Facebook or Instagram module. This was done to decrease respondent burden.     

In addition to the 10,287 internet users who completed the survey, the demographic and profile variables for all 167 active ATP members who do not use the internet (tablet panelists) were also included in the final dataset used in the analysis. This was done so that the dataset and survey weights would represent the population of all U.S. adults, and brings the size of the full analytic sample to 10,454. 

This dataset contains the variables corresponding to questions asked in the survey. It also contains administrative data, such as the main production weight and completion date. There are several types of additional variables that we can typically provide upon request, if they were created for published reporting: 
(1) Researcher-created variable(s) reflecting how we categorized responses to open-ended questions. We do not release verbatim answers to open-ended questions, in the interest of protecting panelist anonymity.
(2) Researcher-created variables needed to replicate published analysis (e.g., an index using several questions).
(3) Special weights needed to replicate published analysis. The main production weight is included in the public dataset. Special weights refer to those used for unusual, bespoke analysis. We can provide existing special weights upon request so long as the analysis they support does not pose a risk to panelist anonymity. 

For a small number of respondents with high risk of identification, certain values have been randomly swapped with those of lower risk cases with similar characteristics.

SMUSE/SMUSE2
SMUSE was asked on W144 as a filter for follow up questions about social media use. SMUSE2 was asked for use as an analytic variable. For the Center's official estimates about social media use in the U.S., please refer to the National Public Opinion Reference Survey (NPORS) Social Media Fact Sheet: https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/
